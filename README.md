# tiidelab-portfolio
I built my personal portfolio website with html and css 

This portfolio website is a task given by a coding facilitator to a group of students which I am part of. 
While working on the website, I learnt how to use svg icons, how to change the background color of a progress 
bar and how to push my project to GitHub and host on netlify live server.
